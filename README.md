## About

**Wanderlust** is a backend MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project inspired by Airbnb. It provides basic functionality for managing property listings and reviews, including:

- **CRUD operations** for listings and reviews
- **User authentication** (sign up, login)
- **Authorization** to ensure users can only modify their own listings and reviews

This project serves as a foundation for building a full-featured rental platform.
